            <h2> Nasi Lemak</h2>
            <p>
                is a dish originating in Malay cuisine that consists of rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf. 
                It is commonly found in Malaysia, where it is considered 
                the national dish.

            <h2> Satay</h2>
            <p>
                a popular Malaysian dish featuring skewered and grilled meat, 
                often served with a side of peanut sauce. 
                It's a favorite at street stalls and restaurants 
                alike, known for its marinated flavors.

            <h2> Laksa </h2>
            <p>
                s a spicy noodle soup that embodies the heart and soul of Malaysian cuisine, 
                featuring a coconut milk-based broth enriched with chili 
                and aromatic herbs. It's a dish that offers a harmonious 
                blend of spicy, savory, and creamy elements.

            <h2> Assam Laksa </h2>
            <p> resembles something between a very thick noodle soup 
                and a noodle dish with a lot of sauce. It is the Laksa 
                sauce that makes all the difference and is one of the 
                main elements that differentiates one Laksa from another. 
                There are several types of Laksa, but Assam Laksa is one 
                of my favourites. Typical of Penang – thick rice noodles
                 with a sweet, sour fish sauce.</p>

                (ex. bean sprout, coagulated pork blood, shrimp, fish, 
                chicken, etc.) with a taste that only the cultural mix 
                can bring: 
                coconut milk, sambal, mint, curry spices.</p>

                Roti Canai is a very popular food in the mornings 
                throughout Malaysia. The best experience is to eat Roti
                Canai in the street stalls while watching the vendors roll
                 out the dough.</p>

                is a very common dish in Malaysia and Singapore, 
                but it is in Kuala Lumpur that you find a very special 
                version of it. Hokkien Mee is made with very thick 
                noodles in a dark, dense soy sauce.

            <p> This dish is made with rice cake cubes in place of the 
                noodles. The texture is super interesting!

                Chai Tow Kway.</p>
