                    It is commonly found in Malaysia, where it is considered

                    a popular Malaysian dish featuring skewered and grilled meat, 
                    often served with a side of peanut sauce. 
                    It's a favorite at street stalls and restaurants 
                    alike, known for its marinated flavors.

                <h2> Laksa </h2>
                <p>
                    s a spicy noodle soup that embodies the heart and soul of Malaysian cuisine, 
                    featuring a coconut milk-based broth enriched with chili 
                    and aromatic herbs. It's a dish that offers a harmonious 
                    blend of spicy, savory, and creamy elements.

                <h2> Assam Laksa </h2>
                <p> resembles something between a very thick noodle soup 
                    and a noodle dish with a lot of sauce. It is the Laksa 
                    sauce that makes all the difference and is one of the 
                    main elements that differentiates one Laksa from another. 
                    There are several types of Laksa, but Assam Laksa is one 
                    of my favourites. Typical of Penang – thick rice noodles
                     with a sweet, sour fish sauce.</p>

                    (ex. bean sprout, coagulated pork blood, shrimp, fish, 
                    chicken, etc.) with a taste that only the cultural mix 
                    can bring: 
                    coconut milk, sambal, mint, curry spices.</p>

                <p> A flatbread that comes with dahl (lentil) and curry. Of 
                    Indian influence, 
                    Roti Canai is a very popular food in the mornings 
                    throughout Malaysia. The best experience is to eat Roti
                    Canai in the street stalls while watching the vendors roll
                     out the dough.</p>

                    is a very common dish in Malaysia and Singapore, 
                    but it is in Kuala Lumpur that you find a very special 
                    version of it. Hokkien Mee is made with very thick 
                    noodles in a dark, dense soy sauce.

                <p> This dish is made with rice cake cubes in place of the 
                    noodles. The texture is super interesting!
                    There is also a version made with radish cake, 
                    Chai Tow Kway.</p>
